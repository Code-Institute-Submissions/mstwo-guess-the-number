## Project rationale

This website is designed to help users play by guessing the hidden number. The game consists of guessing the hidden number by type in the guess one ranging between 1 and 20. Then, check if the input is correct.<br>


# User Experience (UX)

It has been designed in such way that its visitors will be able to navigate the 
web features easily and with help of simple but clean colour combination and game typography. 

## User stories<br>
<ul>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to navigate the page easily.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to type in my guessing number.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to check the correctness of the number I entered.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want a feedback after checking my number.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to know how many attempts I still have remaining to score for each guess and see my top score.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to start the game without losing my current top score.</li>
    <li>As a user, I want to be able to restart the game from scratch.</li>
</ul> 

### Design<br>
The web design main target is to provide the user with the ability to interact with the game. The layout consists of features and elements that allows the user to navigate and use the interact with the game. 
<ul>
    <li>Colour Scheme</li><br>
    - The dominating color throughout the entire layout is dark grey which is combined with light grey color used for header and the instruction card area. In order to make the text content stand out, I used the orange color for typography which created a harmonious combination for both text and buttons background color.<br><br>
    <li>Typography</li><br>
    - The 'Press Start 2P' is the main font that was used while 'Sans Serif' was kept as backup font in case 'Press Start 2P' fails to respond effectively. The two typographies were fetched from google fonts. I found 'Press Start 2P' friendly for games design.<br><br>
    <li>Emoji Icons</li><br>
    - Five emoji icons were used in JavaScript code in order to accompany the user anticipated feelings upon guessing right or wrong in relation to the secret number and from the html 'Attempt' and 'Score' elements.<br>   

</ul>

### Wireframes

The wireframes for the site were created with help of Balsamiq. They feature the site look from different angles i.e computer, mobile phone and tablet views.

## Features

### Existing Features
<ul>
The site layout consists of three main areas:<br><br>
    <li>The header that shows the name and the purpose of the site.</li><br>
    <li>The game area which consits of secret number area where the hidden number is represented by the question mark. It is in this area where the guessed number shows up after a correct match. This styling in this regards also changes from 15rem for the initial and deafult settings to 30rem width after guessing right.<br>
    <li>The input area serves for typing the number. The user can type in or scroll up and down to choose the number. Under this area, is the check button to submit the input for comparison and get the feedback. 
    </li><br>
    <li>The site also includes the 'Attempt' and 'Topscore' features. The Attempt feature which is a counting down from twenty down to zero, shows the user how many times they have tried to reach the perfect match. In case of failure i.e the last attempt equals to zero; then the 'You lost the game' message pops up. On the other hand, the Topscore feature keeps the highest score so far reached.</li><br>
    <li>The 'Again' which is under the attempt and topscore features servers for starting the game session without losing track of the topscore. The game is to reset to the initial settings but keeping the topscore. However, upon refreshing the page the game will start from scratch.</li>
    <li>The last area is the instruction which guide the user on how to play the game.</li>
</ul>

### Features Left to implement
<ul>
    <li>To better improve the game I plan to add on levels of difficulty where the user will be challenged to choose between easy and hard levels. To this level, the user may be provided with only a limited number of attempts to guess right with high score.</li><br>

</ul>

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX)

As a user and the plater at same time of the game on the website, I want to:
<ul>
    <li>Navigate the page easily.</li><br>
    The page layout makes it easier to navigate around. The features on the web page are straightforward to find and get along with with ease.<br><br>
    <li>Type in my guessing number.</li><br>
    The user is provided with the field to enter their prefered number as guess. The user can either type or scroll up or down to select the prefered number.<br><br>
    <li>To be able to check the correctness of the number I entered.</li><br>
    The user check whether their prefered guess number matched or did not match with the hidden secret number. This is done upon clicking the 'Check' button which prompts a feedback. The correct match appears both in the secret number box and the typing box.<br><br>
    <li>Get feedback after checking my number.</li><br>
    Upon clicking the Check button, the user gets a feedback with the phrase 'Wow! Exact number' in case the match was correct, the phrase 'The number is low' in case the number entered  is lower than the secret number and the phrase 'The number is high' in case the number entered is higher than the secret number. The user can also get a failure notification 'You lost the game' after exhausting the counting down attempts with no correct guess.<br><br>
    <li>Know how many attempts still available to score for each guess and see my top score.</li><br>
    The user is provided with the information about how many attempts were tried in a form of counting down as well as the top score reahced so far. Here the topscore is actually equal to the highest value number from the attempts. With this information, the user can strategically plan for the next score.<br><br>
    <li>To start the game without losing my current top score.</li><br>
    For the purpose of competition, the user may need to show off the topscore they reached but without losing the ability to keep playing. In this case, the 'Again' button was set to start the game again without losing track of the topscore.<br><br>
    <li>Restart over the game.</li><br>
    The user can choose to start over the entire game session by refreshing the page. This will reset all game features back to the starting point; topscore included. 
</ul>
